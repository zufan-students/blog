# All Defense Tool
â€‹ First of all, congratulations on finding the treasure. This project integrates excellent open source offensive and defensive weapons projects on the entire network, including information collection tools (automated utilization tools, asset discovery tools, directory scanning tools, subdomain name collection tools, fingerprint identification tools, port scanning tools, various plug-ins... etc...), Vulnerability Exploitation Tools (Major CMS Exploitation Tools, Middleware Exploitation Tools, etc...), Intranet Penetration Tools (Tunnel Agent, Password Extraction...), Emergency Response tools, Party A's operation and maintenance tools, and other security offensive and defensive data are organized for use by both offensive and defensive parties. If you have better suggestions, pull requests are welcome.
